In French, people do not really say I miss you. People say "tu me manques" which means "you are missing from me".

I miss your voice. I miss your face. I miss you so much that I am jealous of the people who have the chance to see your smile everyday.

Sometimes, I wish time could go by faster, to the special day in December that I could be with you.

(Photo was taken for Iris at Mt Eden summit, Auckland. I was the person who stands for "I".)
