In French, people do not really say I miss you. People say "tu me manques" which means "you are missing from me".

I miss your voice. I miss your face. I miss your two litter cute dimples on your cheecks when you smile.

They could be the reason why I would melt for if I am a snowman.

(Photo was taken at Mt Eden summit, Auckland. I was the person who stands for "I".)
