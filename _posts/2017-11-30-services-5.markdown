In French, people do not really say I miss you. People say "tu me manques" which means "you are missing from me".

It has been one whole week since we last saw each other in the cinema.

I miss your voice. I miss your face. I miss your two little cute dimples on your cheeks when you smile.

They could be the reason that I would melt myself for if I am a snowman.
